OpenLayers 
----------

After writting the [OpenLayers Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book)
I have the pleasure to make a presentation for the [GeoInquiets](http://www.geoinquiets.cat/) on December 2012.

This slides tries to show in an interactive way the most important aspects
of OpenLayers and their design.

Any contribution will be appreciated.
