# OpenLayers Presentation 2012 #


After writting the [OpenLayers Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book)
I have the pleasure to make a presentation for the [GeoInquiets](http://www.geoinquiets.cat/) on December 2012.

This slides tries to show in an interactive way the most important aspects
of OpenLayers and their design.

Any contribution will be appreciated.


## Tools used on this presentation ##

This HTML presentation makes use of the tools:

* [deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js): A JavaScript library for building modern HTML presentations.
* [deck.js-codemirror](https://github.com/iros/deck.js-codemirror) extension: Allows you to embed codemirror code snippets in your slides
* [OpenLayers 2.12](http://openlayers.org/): The framework we are talking about.
* All UML class diagrams have been made with the free and online [yUML](http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/draw) tool.

> **Note**: I have been to modify slightly the original OpenLayers `style.css` into `deck.openlayers.style.css` to avoid
issues between OpenLayers and deckjs styles.
